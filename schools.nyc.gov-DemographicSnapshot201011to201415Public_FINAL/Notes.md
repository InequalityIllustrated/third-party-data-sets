# Demographic Snapshot – Citywide, Borough, District, and School

## SY 2010-11 to 2014-15 -- All Grades

Enrollment counts are based on the October 31st Audited Register for each school year.

\*Please note that October 31st enrollment is not audited for charter schools. Charter schools are required to submit enrollment as of BEDS Day, the first Wednesday in October, to the New York State Department of Education.

Enrollment counts in the Demographic Snapshot will likely exceed operational enrollment counts due to the fact that long-term absence (LTA) students are excluded from enrollment for funding purposes.

Data on students with disabilities, English language learners and students povery status are as of the June 30th for each school year except in 2014-15. Data on SWDs, ELLs, and poverty in the 2014-15 school year are as of February 2nd 2015.

All schools listed are as of the 2014-2015 school year. Schools closed before 2014-15 are not included in the school level tab but are included in the data for citywide, borough, and district. Programs and CBO PreK sites are not included on the school tab.

Due to missing demographic information in rare cases at the time of the enrollment snapshot, demographic categories do not always add up to citywide totals.

Students with disabilities are defined as any child receiving an IEP as of the end of the school year (or February 2nd for 2014-15).

NYC DOE “Poverty” counts are based on the number of students with families who have qualified for free or reduced price lunch, or are eligible for Human Resources Administration (HRA) benefits. The poverty indicator also includes students enrolled in a Universal Meal School (where all students automatically qualify). During the 2014-15 school year, all students in middle schools were eligible for free lunch. In order to better reflect free and reduced price lunch status, Universal Meal School (USM) status for middle schools is based on their 2013-14 USM status.

Approximately 25% of charter schools in NYC do not utilize NYC DOE School Food to provide meal services. The NYC DOE Office of School Food does not collect documentation on students’ eligibility for Free or Reduced Price Lunch from schools that do not utilize NYC DOE School Food. As a result, the Free and Reduced Lunch Eligible figures may be understated for approximately 25% of charter schools.

Pre-K enrollment totals include students in both full day and half day programs.
